# Problem Statement

Yumpie emerges as the solution to the four industry issues discussed in the introduction, despite the failures of other attempts. Yumpie is poised to create a one-stop crypto ecosystem that connects global crypto projects and communities by employing the concept of social media as its base.

Although there have been several crypto communities already existing before to Yumpieâ€™s inception, Yumpie was one of few crypto community platforms that did it right.  This is because most platforms, focus their efforts on promote concepts such as "censorship-resistance," "free speech," and "data-privacy," which are not well received by the crypto community. What is the point of having so many similar platforms, the community realises?

Moreover, there have been successful decentralised blogging platform. However, with every success, the copycats follow. Not very innovative, but in plain prose, just emulation.

The industry can be ruthless and unwelcoming to new players. Newly seen expansionism driven interest, such as Grayscale's $10 million investment into the crypto ecosystem, will only be able to advance implementation to a at a minimum rate. That is until the address the industry's crucial quandaries. 

The lack of a clear champion in the crypto social media environment indicates that existing platforms are failing to pique the interest of global cryptocurrency communities. Yumpie discovered that the one aspect that cryptocurrency users are interested in is simply Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology.

To gateway the ability to integrate projects and communities under a unified ecosystem and Yumpie offers a solution to the following four industry dilemmas:

1.	A scenario in which one side of a business arrangement has more information than the other party. In as much as information and knowledge about the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries are not shared uniformly and consistently throughout networks, Schemes unfavourable to the masses have proliferated in the crypto world.

2.	During a bear market, most cryptocurrency start-ups are continually looking for the most cost-effective strategy to raise exposure in the industry. Using traditional channels such as outreach activities and sponsored advertising to promote a project is brilliant but an ineffective investment, nonetheless.

3.	The crypto community struggles to stay focused on one platform due to the widespread use of several social media platforms such as Twitter, Telegram, and Discord. This segmentation has a significant resources and monetary impact, as well as a significant level of community severance.

4.	Most tokens and crypto projects rely on excitement to stay afloat in the market, with little to no utility. Unsurprisingly, the value of most 2017 tokens plummeted to dangerous lows, resulting in a major decline in market interest and the start of a bear market. With newcomers entering the crypto space every day, adoption is once again a faraway fantasy.

5. The more programmes you install on a hard drive, the more components your system has to utilize. The more you use your computer, the faster it ages. Yes, the PC will slow down if you install extra software that runs in the background. Some applications may start up with your computer, slowing down the time it takes for it to boot up. On the other side, you might not be able to afford the software required to reach a goal.
