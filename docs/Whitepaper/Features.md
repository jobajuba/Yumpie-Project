### 🎶Showroom & Blogging⚽
Yumpie's NFT marketplace, powered by YUM, is incorporated into Yostudent VLE to meet the crypto communities' growing NFT-centric needs. Yumpie NFT Marketplace is special in the sense that it offers the following benefits in addition to the standard NFT features:

* For crypto artists, the NFT showroom is must-see. Yumpie's social profile can be utilised as a personal NFT showroom, displaying the community's premium NFT collections.

* Ecosystem of Social-NFT Cryptography When a decentralised wallet is linked to the NFT marketplace, several social features become available, including the ability to share NFTs on Yumpie social media for additional promotion and exposure.

* The platform provides each Yumpie account with a customisable social NFT that will serve as an avatar-like biography on Yumpie. The NFT can be personalised with a variety of cosmetics (from other projects) and Yumpie account activity, such as number of followers, Shard counts, project completion rate and so on.

### 🚀Hub 🏙
YoStudent Hub is a launchpad feature created on YoStudent platform. The Hub gives access and introduces a new crowdfunding concept, in which projects can back the YoStudent series with their own native tokens as well as Yumpie's native token, YUM.

![Launchpad (374)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56c0822e-6e55-4279-8eab-b85c33dc71cb)

Yumpie and the issuing projects can collaborate more closely thanks to the NFT-backing model, which also connects the communities' interest in the NFT launch event on both sides.

The NFT launchpad also contributes to YUM's token utility, as a set amount of YUM must be purchased from the market and burned before it can be used by any project.
