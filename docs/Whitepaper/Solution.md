# Solution

Yumpie purports to be the first social media network to promote the notion of cryptocurrency-focused content. Yumpie can build a community of predominantly cryptocurrency users by balancing the community's interests. The strong specialised network effect will bring additional cryptocurrency users and projects to the platform as the project continues.

Yumpie notably abandons the traditional blogosphere experience in favour of developing a new interface architecture centred around scalability. Yumpie will ultimately evolve into a fast-growing and scalable ecosystem as more users and projects join the platform, allowing for the easy integration of various features and capabilities that benefit the blockchain industry.

The ability to integrate projects and communities under a unified ecosystem offers a solution to the industry’s crucial quandaries:

1.	Yumpie's ecosystem will become a primary source of market intelligence for both blockchain and non-blockchain whenever vantures and people are brought together. Each ecosystem member, particularly novices, may readily access a wealth of information that validates exploratory findings in real time.
2.	Yumpie may be used as a brand-new marketing funnel to generate the most cost-effective visibility and exposure by developing a central social community space for cryptocurrency users. With Yumpie's features like advertising and promoted posts, projects no longer need to rely on the market's existing costly marketing options.
3.	Yumpie's community is primarily comprised of cryptocurrency users, fostering a significant asymmetric encryption network effect. Yumpie will be used by blockchain communities to maintain engagement between one another as the ecosystem develops stronger, eliminating the need for existing social networks such As facebook, Twitter, and Telegram.
4.	Yumpie's embrace of the latest crypto developments, such as DeFi and NFT, is a strong instance of how it expands the ecosystem's use cases. YUM , the ecosystem's principal medium of exchange, will become one of the widely used assets in the crypto market as the ecosystem grows. In comparison to other tokens, YUM is able to retain such a sustainable growth potential due to its increased utilisation potential due to the size of the community.

:::note
Most ventures fail due to two key issues, according to industry experts: failure to build a large enough community and, for projects with large enough communities, failure to maintain community enthusiasm. Yumpie’s solution is to create an ecosystem built on top of a social networking platform. A social media platform is the ideal tool for establishing, growing, and maintaining a project’s community engagement. Yumpie can build a sustainable network and critical mass impact by connecting every bitcoin user in a single ecosystem, bringing new users into the ecosystem on a regular basis.

The concept of leveraging a social media platform gives rise to a linear and scalable business model in contrary to the concept of “Do Things that Don’t Scale”. Yumpie’s ecosystem is made up of several use cases. The utility of YUM and revenue generated by the ecosystem will increase at a cumulative proportion as the ecosystem grows. The greater the incentive and reward funnelled back to each YUM holder, the more money and utility the ecosystem can accumulate. The ecosystem does not have the scalability element to thrive in the bull run and maintain in the bear run without a social media element.

Despite the failures of numerous attempts by would be coming projects, Yumpie emerges as the solution to common development concerns. Yumpie is on track to build a one-stop crypto ecosystem that uses social media as its foundation to connect worldwide enterprises and communities.
