  <h2>How Is the Yumpie Network Secured?</h2>
  <h3>How Secure Is the Yumpie Network?</h3>
  Yumpie is a multi-chain token that is backed by the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol. PoS relies on the quantity of staked tokens for choosing node validators, in contrast to Bitocin's proof-of-work (PoW) consensus.
  In order to combat the enormous power consumption required by PoW devices, PoS protocols were developed. PoS models are becoming and more common since they require less electricity and are simple to scale. PoW has established itself as a trustworthy consensus mechanism, yet Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Solana coins are dominating the market and increasing quickly.
